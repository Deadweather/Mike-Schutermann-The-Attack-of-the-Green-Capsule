Pretty simple. Don't touch certain things or else it won't work.

DO NOT TOUCH THE PLANE OR THE A* OBJECTS. 
Enemy is only mostly off limits.


When adding a player, in the inspector change the "Tag" to "Player" then go into the AstarAI script under My Assets/Scripts 
	and uncomment line 24 about targetposition. That will make the AI move to wherever the player is.

Any obstacles added to the map need to have their "Layer" in the Inspector changed to "Obstacle."



Ask me questions and I might be able to help. Avoid fucking with shit you don't need to be touching.
